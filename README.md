This solution contains a project "Algorithms" with a single class "Samples.cs" with method stubs.
It also contains a unit test project "AlgorithmsTests" with a single class "SamplesTests.cs" with failing test method stubs.

Your job is to write the code implementation of the methods in the Samples.cs class so that they perform the intended function.
You must also write the code for the test methods so that all tests pass

Thank you for your time.
